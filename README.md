<!-- Plugin description -->
## PYZ - a PhpStorm Plugin for Spryker Developers
- Extend Spryker core classes, interfaces and xml files on project level (right-click -> extend in PYZ / CTRL-ALT-E)
- Goto-handling for Zed stub calls and their gateway controller actions (URLs are clickable)  
- Resolve usages of gateway controller actions in Zed stub calls

## About
This plugin was created during the _Turbine Kreuzberg Breakout Week_ as a learning project by a bunch of PHP developers. It is far from perfect. You are welcome to contribute! Feel free to create a pull request, or leave an issue if something does not work.  

## How to use
- To extend files on project level, use the context menu item "Extend in PYZ". It will appear for files located in one of the Spryker vendor directories only.
- Files can be extended in batches, just select multiple files at once.
- You can configure the PYZ directory and the base-namespace in Settings->Tools->PYZ Plugin.
